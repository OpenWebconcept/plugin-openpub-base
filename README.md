# Plugin OpenPub Base

This README documents whatever steps are necessary to get this plugin up and running.

## Installation

### For users

1. Download the latest release from [the releases page](https://github.com/OpenWebconcept/plugin-openpub-base/releases)
2. Unzip and move all files to the `/wp-content/plugins/openpub-base` directory.
3. Log into the WordPress admin and activate the 'Yard | OpenPub Base' plugin through the 'plugins' menu
4. Go to the 'OpenPub instellingen' pagina in the left-hand menu to enter some of the required settings

### For developers

To contribute to this project, no dependencies are required. However, you will need to download [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to run tests or create an optimized build of the plugin.

1. Clone this repository to your machine and/or WordPress installation
2. Optionally use Composer (`composer install`) to install the dev dependencies

To create an optimized and zipped build, run the `composer run package` command. This requires `Composer`, `rsync` and `zip` to run.

## Running tests

cd <path>

# 2. install the composer deps
composer install

# 3. run the tests
phpunit
```

You can run code coverage reports with the command below:

```

## Shared environments

If the OpenPub environment is shared by multiple websites and it is required to configure the websites where an openpub-item should be displayed on, follow the steps below:

### Step 1

Go to the 'OpenPub instellingen pagina' in the left-hand menu and look for the setting 'Show on'. Check the checkbox. When this setting is enabled this plugin creates a taxonomy 'Show on'.

### Step 2

Add terms to the taxonomy so the terms can be used in the editor of an openpub-item.

### Step 3

This plugin adds a select element to the editor of an openpub-item. Look for the select beneath the heading 'External' and select the websites you want this item to be displayed on.

The selected websites are now able to make requests to the items endpoint and only retrieve openpub-items which are intended for the selected website. Example url: https://url/wp-json/owc/openpub/v1/items?source={blog_slug}

## Translations

All of the descriptions, labels and names inside this plugin can be translated since they are controlled by gettext methods. You can find the .pot file at in the languages directory.

> Be careful not to put the translation files in a location which can be overwritten by a subsequent update of the plugin, theme or WordPress core.

Use your own preferred way of translating .pot files, however if this is your first time doing translations within WordPress, we recommend you use the [Loco Translate plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/) which is a great tool for translating WordPress plugins.
