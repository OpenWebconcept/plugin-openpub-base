# TO-DO

-   :skull_and_crossbones: Check translations inside the .po and .pot files (especially line numbers)
-   :ok_hand: Check if other plugins, with this plugin as dependency, still work
-   :brain: Find a better way, in consultation, to convert the applicable meta values instead of manual execution of commands.
